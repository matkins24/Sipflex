        <h6>Company number 8884314</h6>

        <p>
          1.1. These terms of service constitute the agreement between Cloud2Tel Ltd (we or us) and the end user (you, your or customer). By activating or using any of the services, you represent that you are authorised to enter into this agreement and that you have read and understood the terms and conditions of this agreement. <br>
          1.2. Additional terms may apply to your use of some of our services. If so, we will tell you what those terms are. If there is any conflict between these terms and any additional terms, the additional terms will prevail.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h6>2. OUR SERVICES</h6>
        <p>
          2.1. We are not obliged to provide services unless we accept your application. We can decide whether or not to accept any application. <br>
          2.2. You understand that the VoIP service is not a traditional phone service and is provided on a best efforts basis. We will use all reasonable endeavours to make our services available to you at all times, however things beyond our control such as power outages or the performance of your IP connection to our service may disrupt the service we provide. Should there be an interruption in the power supply or ISP broadband outage, the Service will not function until power or the outage is restored, and may require the Customer to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to utilizing the Service. <br>
          2.3. EMERGENCY SERVICES- 999 DIALING. You acknowledge and understand that if there is a service outage for ANY reason, such outage will prevent ALL Service, including 999 dialling. Such outages may occur for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to those reasons described elsewhere in this Agreement. Tel2 strongly recommends that you keep another form of telephone (mobile or landline) to use during those periods when the service is not available. You acknowledge and understand that Tel2's liability is limited for any Service outage and/or inability to dial 999 from your line or to access emergency service personnel, as set forth in this document. <br>
          2.4. Unless otherwise agreed, we do not provide or support your internet connection. You accept that Tel2 might not be compatible with non-voice communications equipment such as alarms, fax machines, cable and medical alarms. <br>

          3.2. All services with Tel2 are pre-paid. You must maintain a positive balance to be able to use the service. We will bill all fixed charges monthly in advance.
